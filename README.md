Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Python project! This is a simple yet engaging implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game designed to be played in the terminal. The project aims
to provide a fun and interactive way to play this timeless game with a friend.

Features:
Two-player mode:   Play against a friend and take turns to mark X or O on the 3x3 grid.Clear and user-friendly interface: The game is played within the terminal, allowing easy
                   accessibility for players.
Input validation:  Ensuring that players input valid moves, preventing accidental mistakes or cheating.
Win detection:     The game automatically checks for a winner or a draw after each move and announces the result.

Error handling:    Gracefully handle any unexpected inputs or errors to maintain  a smooth gameplay.

Installation:
Clone or download the repository.
Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Run python tic_tac_toe.py to start the game.

How to Play:
The game displays a 3x3 grid with numbered positions (1-9) representing each cell.
Players take turns entering the position number where they want to place their marker (X or O).

Code Structure:
The project is organized as follows:-
tic_tac_toe.py: Contains the main game logic and user interface implementation.

Development:
The Tic-Tac-Toe game was developed using Python programming language. The code is designed to be modular, making it easy to understand, modify, and extend. Any suggestions 
or contributions to enhance the game are more than welcome. Please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
